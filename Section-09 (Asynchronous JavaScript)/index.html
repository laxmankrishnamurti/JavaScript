    <p id="description">Asynchronous means "A task which not dependent upon the JS engine, it execute independentally". Like these type of Task JS engine only cares about it's priority order and it's syntax. But, the execution of the task is not in the hand of JS engine. Because, the task can be a Network call, API call or any Database call, and the task is done by some other entities. So, this is all about "Asynchronous Task in JavaScript".</p>
