# Day-02 Operators

## Tasks/Activities

- Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

  - Task 1: Write a program to add two numbwes and log the result to the console.
  - Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
  - Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
  - Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
  - Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

- Activity 2: Assignment Operators

  - Task 6: Use the <code>+=</code> operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
  - Task 7: Use the <code>-=</code> operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

- Activity 3: Comparison Operator

  - Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> > </code> and <code> < </code> and log the result to the console.
  - Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> >= </code> and <code> <= </code> and log the result to the console.
  - Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> == </code> and <code> === </code> and log the result to the console.

- Activity 4: Logical Operator

  - Task 11: Write a program that uses the <code> && </code> operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
  - Task 12: Write a program that uses <code> || </code> operator to combine two conditions(Short-circuit) and log the result to the console.
  - Task 13: Write a program that uses <code> ! </code> operator and negate a condition and log the result to the console.

- Activity 5: Ternary Opeator
  - Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator <code> arg1 ? "if this do this" : "else do this"</code> to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

## Feature Request:

- 1. <b>Arithmetic Operations Script:</b> Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
- 2. <b>Comparison and Logical Operators Script:</b> Create a script that compares two number using different comparison operatos and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
- 3. <b>Ternary Opeator Script:</b> Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
