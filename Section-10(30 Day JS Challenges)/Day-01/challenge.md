# Day-01: Variables and Data Types

## Task/Activities:

    - Activity1 1 : Variable Declaration
        - Task 1: Declare a variable using "var", assign it a number, and log the value to the console
        - Task 2: Declare a variable using "let", assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

    - Activity 2 : Constant Declaration
        - Task 3: Declare a variable using "const", assign it a boolean value, and log the value of the console.

    - Activity 3 : Data Types
        - Task 4: Create variables of different data types(number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the "typeof" operator.

    - Activity 4 : Reassigning Variables
        - Task 5: Declare a variable using "let", assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

    - Activity 5 : Understanding "const"
        - Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with "const" and observe the error

## Feature Request:

    - 1. Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

    - 2. Reassignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between "let" and "const" when it comes to reassignment.
