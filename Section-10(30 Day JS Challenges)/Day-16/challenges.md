- Activity 05: Tree Traversal (Optional)
  - Task 09: Write a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Log the nodes as they are visited.
  - Task 10: Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree. Log the result for a few test cases.

## Let's learn about Recursion.

- <code>Recursion</code> :: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem until it reaches a base case.

There are two main important thing that we have to focun on it.

- Base case : Helps to terminate the recursive pattern
- Recursive Case : Function should be calling itself with modified arguments untill it will not reached to the base case.

- Recursion is particularly effective when the problem can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems that follow a specific pattern.
