# Day-15 (Closures)

## Task/Activity

- Activity 01: Understanding Closures

  - Task 01: Write a function that returns another function. where the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function's scope. Call the inner function and log the result.
  - Task 02: Create a closure that maintains a private counter, implement functions to increment and get the current value of the counter.

- Activity 02: Practical Closures

  - Task 03: Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep tract of the last generated ID and increment it with each call.
  - Task 04: Create a closure that captures a user's name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

- Activity 03: Closures in Loops

  - Task 05: Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

- Activity 04: Modul Pattern

  - Task 06: Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove and list items.

- Activity 05: Memoization
  - Task 07: Write a function that memoizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.
  - Task 08: Create a memoized version of a function that calculates tha factorial of a number.
