## Task/Activity

- Activity 01: Understanding Promises

  - Task 01: Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console.
  - Task 02: Create a promise that rejects with an error message after 2-second timeout and handle the error using <code>.catch()</code>

- Activity 02: Chaining Promises

  - Task 03: Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order.

- Activity 03: Using Async/Await

  - Task 04: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then log the resolved value.
  - Task 05: Write an async function that handles a rejected promise using try-catch and log the error message.

- Activity 04: Fetching Data from an API

  - Task 06: Use the <code>fetch</code> API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promise.
  - Task 07: Use the <code>fetch</code> API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using async/await.

- Activity 05: Concurrent Promises
  - Task 08: Use <code>Promise.all</code> to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values.
  - Task 09: Use <code>Promise.race</code> to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
